# CyberLab-Project

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project is a responsive CyberLab Student View, build with HTML and CSS.As part of my senior project I, our goal was to design a cyberLab website for cybersecurity student. This is our second working prototype for the project which I was in charge of designing using HTML and CSS. After our group came up with a final mockup for the cyberlab website for the student view, I took the responsability to create a working product using HTML and CSS.The project itself is designed using an angular project, the functionalities are recreated using HTML and CSS.This project showcases my front-end development skills.
